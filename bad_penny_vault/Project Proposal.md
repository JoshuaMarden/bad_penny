Track and conceptualise the economic degradation of the UK.

Collect economic data from different sources and present it in a dashboard. For each chart of financial data, have a second line where it is offset by inflation.

Allow the user to guess what they think inflation really is, as well as Trueflation latest estimate.

Helps users in two ways, with two _'hecks'_: 
1. _"Why the heck am I worse off than I was?"_ - Help a user understand why they feel poorer, and where their money is going. 
2. _"How the heck can I pump the breaks on this?"_ - Help a user identify assets that can insulate them against the decline (Short term this will be limited to Gold, BTC, and of course, property)
